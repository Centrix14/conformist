# Conformist
Conformist is a pattern matching library, that i started as a part of my CAS.

# Features
As a real programmer i don't present realized features, i speaking about my plans.
1. Pattern matching for S-expression with placeholders, like `:symbol`, `:list` and another.
2. Flexible system of placeholders.
3. Pattern grouping (see chapter "thoughts" in org-file).

# What i have at the time?
Very simple library, but soon i will expand it.
