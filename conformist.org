#+title: «Conformist» pattern matching library
#+author: Centrix14
#+startup: overview

* What is it for?
Initially, i developed =conformist= as a component of =calg= — my CAS. This library provides function =matchp=, that returns =t= if given =data= matches =pattern= (=nil= otherwise).

* Syntax of =matchp
=matchp= takes pattern as first argument and data for matching as second. Pattern can contain:
1. Placeholders a special /keywords/, that describes type of symbol(s), that must be in the on position of placeholder. There are following placeholders:
   - =:symbol= describes one symbol
   - =:list= describes one list
   - =:symbols= describes one or more symbols
   - =:lists= describes one or more lists
   - =:etc= describes one or more symbols or lists
2. Concrete values.

* =conformist= system
Nothing interesting here at all.

* =:conformist= package
Just a package description

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (defpackage :conformist
    (:use :common-lisp))
#+end_src

* Placeholders
As i already said =matchp= works with placeholders. Variable =*placeholders*= contains list of placeholders, that =matchp= will recognize.

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (in-package :conformist)

  (defvar *placeholders* (list :symbol :list))
#+end_src

=placeholderp= is a predicate that returns =t= if given value is a placeholder.

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (defun placeholderp (data)
    (member data *placeholders*))
#+end_src

Ok, now we have basics of placeholders and can write a function that compares some data with given placeholder (we suppose that given =placeholder= is a real placeholder).

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (defun does-placeholder-matches-data (placeholder data)
    (cond
      ((eql placeholder :symbol)
       (symbolp data))
      ((eql placeholder :list)
       (listp data))))
#+end_src

If you ask me, why this code so simple and not flexible, i give an answer: this is a temporary solution, soon i will make it more complicated.

* Matching
Well, now we can +take chance on me+ (sorry for ABBA-speaking). Now we can describe matching mechanism. Here, we begin from the most simple function, that returns =t=, if some symbol =a= matches another symbol =b=.

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (in-package :conformist)

  (defun does-a-matches-b (a b)
    (if (placeholderp a)
        (does-placeholder-matches-data a b)
      (equal a b)))
#+end_src

As you can see this function uses =does-placeholder-matches-data= function of =a= is a placeholder, or just returns equivalence of symbols.

#+begin_comment
In this function i use =equal= because given data may be lists, and =(eql '(1 2 3) '(1 2 3))= is not =t=.
#+end_comment

Since this solution is temporary, i separated safe and unsafe version of =matchp=, here is a unsafe version (works not correctly when pattern and data has different length).

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (defun matchp-not-safe (pattern data)
    (if (null pattern)
        t
        (let ((pattern-elm (car pattern))
              (data-elm (car data)))
         (if (listp pattern-elm)
             (and (matchp-not-safe pattern-elm data-elm)
                  (matchp-not-safe (cdr pattern) (cdr data)))
             (and (does-a-matches-b pattern-elm data-elm)
                  (matchp-not-safe (cdr pattern) (cdr data)))))))
#+end_src

At least, i define =matchp= function, as a safe version of unsafe =mathcp=.

#+begin_src lisp :tangle conformist.lisp
  (defun matchp (pattern data)
    (if (= (length pattern)
           (length data))
        (matchp-not-safe pattern data)
        nil))
#+end_src

* Examples
Current version of =matchp= is very simple. Here is an examples of usage (all of them returns =t=).

#+begin_src lisp :tangle example.lisp
  ;; :list placeholder describes list
  (matchp '(:list) '((1 2 3)))

  ;; :symbol placeholder describes one symbol
  (matchp '(:symbol) '(a))

  ;; :etc placeholder describes one and more symbols
  (matchp '(:etc) '(a b c))

  ;; placeholders may be nested
  (matchp '(:symbol (:symbol :list)) '(a (b (c d))))

  ;; you can mix placeholders and values
  (matchp '(a :symbol (b :list c)) '(a / (b (1 2 3) c)))

  (:symbol (:symbol :lists))
  (a (b (1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
#+end_src

* TODO [0/3]
- [ ] Add =:lists=, =:symbols= and =:etc= placeholders
- [ ] Reduce recursion
- [ ] Add grouping

* Thoughts
How grouping must work? Generally, grouping provide a new list, that can be one-to-one matched to given.

Some examples.

#+begin_example
  Pattern:  (:symbol :symbol)
  Data:     (a b)
  Grouping: ((a) (b))

  Pattern:  (:list :list)
  Data:     ((1 2 3) (a b c))
  Grouping: (((1 2 3)) ((a b c)))

  Pattern:  (:symbol :list)
  Data:     (a (1 2 3))
  Grouping: ((a) ((1 2 3)))

  Pattern:  (:symbols)
  Data:     (a b c)
  Grouping: ((a b c))

  Pattern:  (:lists)
  Data:     ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
  Grouping: (((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))

  Pattern:  (:symbols :lists)
  Data:     (a b c (1 2 3) (4 5 6))
  Grouping: ((a b c) ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
